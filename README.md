Through this kernel, I will try some of the most commonly used encoding techniques. This notebook was regerened from the Kaggle competition: Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge

As this competition mainly deals with encoding and it would be a great to refresh some the most common and effective encoding techniques currently in use.

I will also run and test each of these encoding techniques in a simple logistic regression model and finally observe the performance of each type of encoding.
